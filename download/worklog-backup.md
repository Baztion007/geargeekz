Task ID: qa-round4
Agent: Main (Cron Review)
Task: QA testing, dark mode toggle integration, bug investigation, and final verification

Work Log:
- Performed comprehensive QA testing with agent-browser: all pages load with 200 status, no console errors
- Verified testimonials section on homepage ("What Our Readers Say")
- Verified "Guides" navigation button in header
- Found theme toggle was not added to Header by subagent — manually added it:
  - Imported Sun, Moon, Monitor icons and useThemeStore
  - Added theme toggle button in header right section (desktop) with icon + label
  - Added theme toggle in mobile menu panel
  - Cycles light → dark → system on click
- Tested dark mode toggle: confirmed it works (dark class applied to document.documentElement)
- Tested reviews API: found runtime issue with Prisma client cache (db.userReview undefined)
  - Root cause: Next.js dev server cached old PrismaClient module before UserReview model was added
  - Verified reviews API works correctly via bun CLI (creates and fetches reviews)
  - Code is correct; issue is runtime module caching that resolves on server restart
- Lint passes cleanly
- All pages functional

Current Project Status:
- Fully functional Amazon affiliate site with 16 products, 5 categories, 6 blog articles, 5 buying guides, 2 authors
- Complete SPA with hash-based routing, responsive design, Amazon-inspired styling
- Dark mode support with light/dark/system toggle and all pages styled for dark theme
- User reviews feature (API + component) — code correct, runtime caching issue in dev
- Mobile compare FAB, scroll progress bar, skeleton loading states
- Testimonials section on homepage
- Featured article hero on blog page
- Dedicated Guides page with category filtering
- Quick View modal, wishlist, compare, recently viewed features all working
- Image lightbox with keyboard navigation on product detail pages
- Sticky mobile CTA bar and mobile compare FAB
- Newsletter and price alert backend APIs functional
- All affiliate links properly formatted with tracking ID and nofollow/sponsored

Unresolved Issues / Risks:
- Reviews API has runtime Prisma client caching issue in dev mode (works in fresh process)
- Some new product/guide images return 404 (need generation)
- CompareBar only shows on desktop (mobile uses FAB instead)
- No sitemap.xml generation yet
- No automated email notifications for price alerts

Priority Recommendations for Next Phase:
- Generate images for new buying guides and products
- Add per-page JSON-LD structured data
- Add sitemap.xml generation for SEO
- Implement email notification service for price alerts
- Add product video reviews section
- Add user reviews/comments on blog posts
- Add A/B testing for affiliate CTA buttons

Task ID: 2b-pages-2
Agent: Pages Developer
Task: Create BrandPage, rewrite SearchPage/Header/Footer, update page.tsx routing

Work Log:

### 1. `/src/components/views/BrandPage.tsx` — NEW FILE
Created a full brand page with 5 sections:
- **Brand Hero**: Dark gradient hero card with brand icon, name, description, founded date, headquarters, official website link. Stats badges: Products Reviewed, Avg. Rating, Categories count.
- **Products by Brand**: Sortable product grid (Top Rated / Name / Recently Updated) using `getProductsByBrand(brandSlug)` and ProductCard components.
- **Buying Guides Featuring Brand**: Auto-discovers buying guides that recommend products from this brand. Cards show guide type badge and reading time.
- **Brand Categories**: Category buttons linking to category pages from `brand.categories` array.
- **Related Brands**: Filters brands sharing categories with current brand. Grid of clickable brand cards with product count.
- **Not Found State**: Graceful fallback when brand slug is invalid.
- Uses `Breadcrumbs` with `route` prop (not `onClick`), `Disclosure`, `StarRating`.

### 2. `/src/components/views/SearchPage.tsx` — MAJOR REWRITE
Complete rewrite from product-only search to multi-content-type search:
- **Cross-content search**: Searches products (title/tags/brand/category/excerpt), categories (name/description/slug), brands (name/description/slug), buying guides (title/excerpt/category/guideType), blog posts (title/excerpt/category/tags).
- **Tab navigation**: All, Products, Categories, Brands, Guides, Blog — each with count badge.
- **Product results**: Uses ProductCard (NO prices, merchant-aware CTAs).
- **Category results**: Cards with gradient image, product count badge, name, description.
- **Brand results**: Cards with Building2 icon, name, product count — links to brand page.
- **Guide results**: Cards with guide type badge (uppercase), reading time, category, excerpt.
- **Blog results**: Cards with reading time, date, category, tags, excerpt.
- **No results state**: PackageOpen icon, popular searches, category browsing.
- **Related searches**: Suggestion tags filtered by current query.
- **Browse All Categories**: Footer section with all categories.
- Removed all coffee references (espresso, grinder, pour-over, breville, etc. → travel, headphones, anker, backpack, etc.)
- Placeholder text: "Search gear, reviews, and guides..."

### 3. `/src/components/layout/Header.tsx` — MAJOR REWRITE
- **Branding**: Changed "BrewHub" to "GearScope" everywhere with `Gear<span className="gradient-text">Scope</span>` format.
- **Logo icon**: Changed from coffee cup SVG to magnifying glass SVG (`<circle cx="11" cy="11" r="8"/><path d="m21 21-4.3-4.3"/>`).
- **Tagline**: Added "Expert Reviews. Smart Recommendations." below logo (visible on sm+).
- **Navigation items**: Updated to Trending, Guides, Blog, About (removed "Today's Deals", "Best Sellers", "Reviews").
- **Removed**: Cart button (ShoppingCart icon) — not an e-commerce site.
- **Removed**: Account/Returns buttons — replaced with cleaner wishlist-only right section.
- **Kept**: Search bar, theme toggle, wishlist button, mobile slide-in panel.
- **Mobile menu**: Panel header shows "GearScope" instead of "Menu".
- **Search placeholder**: "Search gear, reviews, and guides..." (was "Search coffee gear...").

### 4. `/src/components/layout/Footer.tsx` — MAJOR REWRITE
- **Branding**: Changed "BrewHub" to "GearScope" everywhere.
- **Categories**: Updated from coffee categories (Espresso Machines, Coffee Grinders, etc.) to GearScope categories (Travel Gear, Travel Gadgets, Electronics, Home & Office, Fitness).
- **"Get to Know Us" links**: "About GearScope" (was "About BrewHub").
- **Trust badges**: Updated to match GearScope — "Expert-Tested Gear" (was "Researched Products"), "Unbiased Reviews" (was "Expert Recommendations"), "Multi-Retailer" (was "Independent Reviews" — now mentions Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy).
- **Affiliate disclosure**: Updated from Amazon-only to multi-merchant — "GearScope earns commissions from qualifying purchases through affiliate links on this site. We participate in affiliate programs with Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, and other retailers."
- **Copyright**: "© 2026 GearScope. All rights reserved."

### 5. `/src/app/page.tsx` — UPDATED
- **Added**: `import { BrandPage } from '@/components/views/BrandPage'`
- **Added**: `import { TrendingPage } from '@/components/views/TrendingPage'`
- **Added**: `case 'brand': return <BrandPage brandSlug={route.slug} />` route
- **Changed**: `case 'trending'` now returns `<TrendingPage />` (was `<HomePage />`)
- **Removed**: DealsPage/BestSellersPage imports (comment already existed)
- **Updated**: Motion key includes `brand-${route.slug}` for brand route transitions

### 6. BreadcrumbItem Type Fix
- Fixed BrandPage breadcrumbs: changed `{ label: 'Home', onClick: goHome }` to `{ label: 'Home', route: { page: 'home' } }` to match BreadcrumbItem interface which uses `route?: RoutePath` not `onClick`.

Stage Summary:
- Brand page with full brand profile, products, guides, related brands — all using data layer
- Search page now searches across 5 content types (products, categories, brands, guides, blogs) with tab filtering
- Header rebranded to GearScope with magnifying glass logo, new nav items, no cart/account

- page.tsx routes brand and trending pages correctly
